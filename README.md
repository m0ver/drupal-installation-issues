    # In Drupal 8, we must also match new paths where the '.php' appears in

    # This allows legacy path aliases in the form of
    # blog/index.php/legacy-path to continue to route to Drupal nodes. If
    # you do not have any paths like that, then you might prefer to use a
    # laxer rule, such as:

## How could I use Oracle as Drupal database?
You need to install the oracle driver first under the drupal root folder. 
```
composer require 'drupal/oracle:1.x-dev@dev'
composer install
```
so before you execute the command, you need to install composer first.
and also you need to copy the driver folder under DRUPAL_ROOT, as there is a logic to validate the folder and scan for drivers: `DRUPAL_ROOT . '/drivers/lib/Drupal/Driver/Database`
## How to install Composer?
Please see the documentation: https://getcomposer.org/download/
## What's difference after I install the drupal oracle driver?
You will see a new database type in the database installation page.
## Why I could not see Oracle database type from the installation page?
There is a logic in drupal core to validate pdo_oci module in PHP. If you have installed it, you would be able to see the Oracle database type.
## How could I install pdo_oci module?
- Install the [InstantClient](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/linux-x86-64-downloads.html) from RPMs. You need install basic package, developement and runtime package as well.
- Download the PHP sources, matching the current PHP version installed php -v
```

## Error: ORA-00955: name is already used by an existing object
Please refer to the article: https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/error-ora-00955-name-already-used-existing-object
## ORA-00972: identifier is too long
Database object names in 11g as well as in 12cR1 are limited to 30 bytes (in a single-byte character set it will be equivalent to 30 characters).
The 30 bytes object names restriction has been lifted in second release of Oracle Database 12c (12cR2) and if the value of the COMPATIBLE initialization parameter is set to 12.2 or higher then object names' length can be up to 128 bytes.
If you could not change Oracle version, you can change the CONSTANTS in Oracle driver (Connection.php) to be: `define('ORACLE_IDENTIFIER_MAX_LENGTH', 30);`
